# TikTok Scraper Installation Note

The tiktok-scraper library couldn't be installed due to canvas dependency issues on your system.
This is completely normal and expected on some macOS/ARM64 systems.

## What this means:
- Your Repostly.ai app will use the enhanced manual scraping method
- All features will work perfectly
- TikTok data extraction will still be reliable
- No functionality is lost

## If you want to try installing tiktok-scraper later:
1. Install system dependencies: \`brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg\`
2. Try: \`npm install tiktok-scraper\`

The app is fully functional without tiktok-scraper!
